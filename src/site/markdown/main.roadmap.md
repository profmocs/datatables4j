<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<hr />

There is still so much work to be done ... :-)

<h4>1.0.0 Release</h4>

The first major release must include some basic capabilities like :

<ul>
<li>Export in different types (CSV, XML, PDF, ...) and extension points, allowing DataTables4j users to override default export implementations.</li>
<li>Real tests. Currently, the demo application is mainly used as integration tests (shame on me ...)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.1.0 Release</h4>

I'd like to add an external module loader, allowing :
<ul>
 <li>users to write their own plugin</li>
 <li>web application to load and use plugin at runtime (on-the-fly)</li>
</ul>
